3D Printed Case for Wood Stove Regulator

Configuration is wall mounted case with Arduino ports facing downward,
LCD screen centered vertically on the top case with control knobs below it.
Control cable exits the case on the bottom of the case as mounted.

Modeled using Autodesk Fusion 360 and printed using PLA filament.
Case was modified from:
Arduino-UNO-DIN-Case (6TE) (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3402441)
Changes to case and other printed parts:
- made bottom deeper to accommodate a breadboard shield for the Arduino
- added support ribbing to the top case to improve print quality
- changed holes and clamp in case to work with the push/pull cable and the thermocouple wire
- added a support mounting surface for the thermocouple amplifier
- added mounting pillars to support the servo inside the bottom case
- added a new wall mount and a cable connection piece for the wood stove damper
